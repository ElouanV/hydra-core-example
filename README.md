### Description
Hydra is an open-source Python framework that simplifies the development of research and other complex applications. The key feature is the ability to dynamically create a hierarchical configuration by composition and override it through config files and the command line. The name Hydra comes from its ability to run multiple similar jobs - much like a Hydra with multiple heads.
### Key features
- Hierarchical configuration composable from multiple sources
- Configuration can be specified or overridden from the command line
- Dynamic command line tab completion
- Run your application locally or launch it to run remotely
- Run multiple jobs with different arguments with a single command
